# Address-book
Command-line address-book made in python3


This is my first program in python, feel free to comment or suggest changes.

This programm can manage a address-book, saving name, email, and phone number of a contact.
The contacts can be accessed, saved and loaded by the user.
The contacts' email and phone number can be edited.
